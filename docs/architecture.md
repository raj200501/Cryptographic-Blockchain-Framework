# ACBF Architecture

## Overview

The Advanced Cryptographic Blockchain Framework (ACBF) is designed to integrate advanced cryptographic techniques, blockchain interactions, smart contract development, and decentralized applications (DApps).

## Components

1. **Cryptography**: Provides symmetric and asymmetric encryption, along with hash functions.
2. **Blockchain**: Scripts for interacting with blockchain networks, including balance checking, transaction sending, contract deployment, and contract interaction.
3. **Smart Contracts**: Smart contract development, compilation, deployment, and interaction scripts.
4. **DApp**: Frontend and backend code for decentralized applications.
5. **Documentation**: Detailed documentation for each component.
6. **Deployment**: Scripts for deploying the application using Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.
